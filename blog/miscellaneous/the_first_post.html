<p>There's a certain insecurity inherent in declaring a project finished. There are always more features to be added and bugs to be fixed. Saying that you're finished is effectively admitting that you were unable to add that feature or fix that bug. So then, I won't say that this website is finished, but I do think it's good enough for now.</p>
<p>Creating this website has taken more time than I thought it would. There are a few reasons for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>CSS is infinitely fiddly, especially when you have worry about mobile screen sizes.</li>
<li>I stubbornly refused to use media queries. Flexbox seemed to be, and ultimately was, enough to support all screen sizes on its own, but using media queries would probably have been a more straightforward option.</li>
<li>This website is hosted using GitHub Pages, which means it has effectively no back end. This makes something like keeping a blog more complicated because adding content requires modifying front end code in some capacity. Settling on and creating a solution for this took some time.</li>
</ol>

<p>To mitigate the issue of updating the blog, I decided to create a script that takes a bunch of files written in a simple domain-specific language and parses them into HTML. The actual source file for this page looks like this:</p>

Creating this website has taken more time than I thought it would. There are a few reasons for that:

&lt;list&gt;
    1. CSS is infinitely fiddly, especially when you have worry about mobile screen sizes.
    2. I stubbornly refused to use media queries. Flexbox seemed to be, and ultimately was, enough to support all screen sizes on its own, but using media queries would probably have been a more straightforward option.
    3. This website is hosted using GitHub Pages, which means it has effectively no back end. This makes something like keeping a blog more complicated because adding content requires modifying front end code in some capacity. Settling on and creating a solution for this took some time.
&lt;/list&gt;

To mitigate the issue of updating the blog, I decided to create a script that takes a bunch of files written in a simple domain-specific language and parses them into HTML. The actual source file for this page looks like this:

Then, an index is generated based on the file hierarchy of the directory containing the blog source files and is inserted into each HTML page.

Parsing will probably be the subject of my next series of posts, maybe starting with parsing expression grammar.</code></pre></div>
